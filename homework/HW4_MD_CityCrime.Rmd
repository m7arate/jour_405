title: "HW4 MD CityCrime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv")
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- md_cities %>%
  mutate(
    violent_rate_2019 = (violent2019 / pop2019) * 100000,
    property_rate_2019 = (property2019 / pop2019) * 100000,
    violent_rate_2020 = (violent2020 / pop2020) * 100000,
    property_rate_2020 = (property2020 / pop2020) * 100000
  )
```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

Ocean City has seen an increase in violent crime, Baltimore used to be number one in violent crime while Ocean City saw the most property crime, not Ocean City is the highest in both.


### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities_rates %>%
  mutate(
    violent_rate_change = ((violent_rate_2020 - violent_rate_2019) / violent_rate_2019) * 100,
    property_rate_change = ((property_rate_2020 - property_rate_2019) / property_rate_2019) * 100
  )

```

### Task 7: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

Initially Edmonston having an 800% increase in violent crim was alarming, but then I looked and saw the sample size was not sufficient. I think the story here is that Baltimore has seen pretty significant drops in violent and property crime between 2019 and 2020, which could be related to the global pandemic. Baltimore is a big city and likely had strict lockdowns.

### Task 8: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

Baltimore has seen a sharp decrease in both violent and property crime over the course of 2019 and 2020. This might be attributed to the pandemic and the lockdowns that followed suit. 

In 2019, Baltimore 11,101 violent crimes and 25,748 property crimes. Violent crimes have decreased by 12.9% and property crimes have decreased by 25.9%.

### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.
